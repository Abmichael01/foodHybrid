description: I will paste Tailwind code copied from Figma.Do NOT use width or height classes unless it's for images, icons, or essential elements (e.g.,spacers, avatars, or where it's semantically required). If you see width or height classes (like w-[] or h-[]) on other elements, remove or convert them to use Tailwind spacing, padding, or flex/grid utilities as appropriate. For images or icons, keep the width and height if present, otherwise optimize responsively.Make all code idiomatic for Tailwind and best practices for responsive design. If Figma exports absolute positioning, try to convert it to flex, grid, or relative positioning with Tailwind utilities. Point out any Figma-specific styling that does not translate well to Tailwind and suggest alternatives. Do NOT use inline styles. If I need to add or modify tailwind.config.js for custom colors, spacing, or fonts, give me the exact config snippet. If you need project-specific context (like custom theme or breakpoints), ask me for it. alwaysApply: false
